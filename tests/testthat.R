# This file is part of the standard testthat setup.
# Run tests with: testthat::test_local() or devtools::test()

library(testthat)

# When this becomes a package, uncomment:
# library(gtopokr)  # or whatever the package name becomes
# test_check("gtopokr")

# For now, source the R files and run tests manually:
# source("R/compositional.R")
# source("R/metrics.R")
# testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat")
